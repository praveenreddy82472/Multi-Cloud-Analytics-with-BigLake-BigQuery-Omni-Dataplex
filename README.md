# Multi-Cloud Analytics with BigLake, BigQuery Omni & Dataplex

## Objective

Build a scalable multi-cloud analytics solution that enables seamless querying of data stored across Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and Azure Blob Storage, leveraging Google Cloudâ€™s BigLake and BigQuery Omni. Integrate Dataplex for centralized data governance and metadata management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

Data is stored raw in GCS and Azure Blob Storage.

BigLake exposes external tables on top of these cloud storage files.

BigQuery Omni enables cross-cloud querying with a federated identity connection to Azure.

Dataplex manages metadata, data zones, and governance policies across clouds.

---

## Key Steps

Uploaded sample data files to GCS and Azure Blob Storage.

Created BigLake external tables referencing these files via BigQuery Omni.

Configured federated identity for secure cross-cloud authentication.

Used Dataplex to set up lakes, zones, and assets for unified metadata and governance.

Queried external tables in BigQuery to analyze data across clouds.

---
## Challenges & Solutions

Authentication: Set up Azure App Registration and federated identity to enable secure access.

Region Alignment: Ensured BigQuery datasets are in the same region as the BigQuery Omni connection.

Permissions: Assigned correct Azure Blob Storage roles to the Google service account.

Governance: Leveraged Dataplex for consistent metadata and policy management.

---
## Impact & Benefits
Unified analytics platform querying multi-cloud data without data duplication.

Reduced storage and compute costs by querying external tables.

Centralized data governance and metadata management.

Scalable architecture supporting hybrid and multi-cloud strategies.

## How to Run
Upload data to GCS and Azure Blob Storage.

Create a BigQuery dataset in region azure-eastus2.

Configure federated identity between GCP and Azure AD.

Create BigLake external tables using existing connections.

Set up Dataplex lakes and zones.

Query data using BigQuery SQL.
